# Hawaiian Pizza Knowledge Base

## Origins and History
- Hawaiian pizza was invented in 1962 by Sam Panopoulos, a Greek-born Canadian, at his restaurant Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario, Canada.
- Despite its name, Hawaiian pizza has no connection to Hawaii. The name comes from the brand of canned pineapple that was used.
- Panopoulos was inspired by Chinese dishes that combined sweet and savory flavors.
- Initially considered unusual, the pizza gained popularity throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

- The variety typically used is sweet gold pineapple
- Fresh pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain that can break down proteins and affect cheese melting
- Canned pineapple is often preferred as the canning process neutralizes this enzyme
